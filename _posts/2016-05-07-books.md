_[Pestilence][0]_ (Keyhole Press, 2013)
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/328b33a1-1cf9-4315-a752-dd9d29b986e2.jpg)

A boy whose skin is multiple colors. A home that freezes in the middle of summer. A pair of brothers who witness the apocalypse and attempt to fight it. A boy with four arms. A rogue wave that destroys a landlocked city. A house whose occupants experience different plagues each day. The six stories that populate this chapbook slough off the notion of reality, replacing it with an unsettling irreality that may be, upon closer inspection, the work of something sinister. What cannot be explained must still be endured. And so, let there be pestilence.

_[The Dying Horse][1]_ (Main Street Rag, 2012)

"Natural disasters are running wild. The world is ending. Cats are talking. In the wake of an apocalypse, a young man is on a journey, of sorts, and along the way he meets a strange cast of characters who may or may not get in his way. The line between the real and surreal is a thin one in Jason Jordan's wildly entertaining _The Dying Horse_. With wry humor, Jordan tells the story of a man who just wants to find his way to some kind of home." ---Roxane Gay, author of _Ayiti_

_[Cloud and Other Stories][2]_ (Six Gallery Press, 2010)

An artist befriends an ocean. Organs exit bodies of their own volition. A man cuts himself in half to better multitask. These are merely a few of the things that take place in Jason Jordan's second collection _Cloud and Other Stories_. Organized according to where the stories were written, Jordan's eclectic compilation traces his path from Louisville, Kentucky, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, through fiction. Though he's absent from these stories, they're firmly rooted in the places he's lived, the places that have influenced him and his work beyond measure.

_[Powering the Devil's Circus: Redux][3]_ (Six Gallery Press, 2010)

Ranging from a variety of topics, Jason Jordan's short work has been called experimental because it breaks tradition with respect to obvious boundaries such as font, design, layout, and length, but perhaps more importantly, to theme, plot, character and dialogue. In one story, for instance, a tube uses instant messenger technology to converse with its owner. The novella, included within, might just be the highlight of the book. The author writes about himself, as a student, attending a Christian school, listening to metal music. Then he goes to college. Then he becomes a writer. And as the title of one chapter indicates, the author finds alcohol rather than Jesus and, at some point, ends up in Hell (Michigan).
